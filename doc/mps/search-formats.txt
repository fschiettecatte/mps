Search Syntax in pseudo-BNF notation:
-------------------------------------

A vertical line '|' indicates alternatives
An escape '\' means just that
Brackets '[]' indicate optional parts
Brackets with elipsis '[...]' indicate repeating optional parts

digit       := 0-9
sign        := [+,-]
number      := [sign] digit[...]
weight      := [sign]number[.number]
character   := [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -]
word        := character[character\*\?[...]][\[weight\]]
field       := character[...]
range       := = | > | >= | < | <= | !=
function    := soundex | typo | metaphone | phonix | literal | range
lparen      := (
rparen      := ) 
operator    := ADJ | NEAR | OR | AND | NOT 
modifier    := {NOHITS} | {NOREPORT} | {SORT:RELEVANCE:ASC} | {SORT:RELEVANCE:DESC} | {SORT:DATE:ASC} | {SORT:DATE:DESC} | 
        {SORT:field:ASC} | {SORT:field:DESC} | {OR} | {AND} | {ADJ} | {NEAR[\[number\]]} | 
        {DATE range number} | {BOOLEANRELAXED} | {BOOLEANSTRICT}
term        := [field range][function\[]word\]
phrase      := [field range]"word [...]"
terms       := [field range lparen]|[ lparen ] term|phrase|terms [operator] term|phrase|terms [ rparen ]

search      := terms [modifier [...]]


Operator precendence in ascending order:

    ADJ, NEAR, OR, AND, NOT, ()

author=(marchionini AND croft) {DATE>1990}
author=(marchionini AND croft) AND title=(computer AND encyclopedia) {DATE=1990}

soundex[marchionini]
author=soundex[marchionini]
typo[marchionini]
metaphone[marchionini]
phonix[marchionini]
author=typo[marchionini]
(((ti=a ADJ ti=b) AND (c ADJ d)) OR (e AND F*))
((company OR picnic OR term)  (apple OR computers))
(lowland gorilla AND adult male) OR (canopic jar)
information retrieval systems NOT wais
information retrieval systems NOT "wide area information servers"
((company picnic term) NOT (apple computers))
company picnic term NOT "apple computers"
company picnic term AND "apple computers"
company AND pinic NOT apple AND computers
marchionini NEAR[10] croft
marchionini NEAR[+20] croft
marchionini NEAR[-30] croft
marchionini[0.7] croft[1.4]
this is a test of the free text retrieval portions without brackets {AND}
